// lib/effort.mjs — the effort store: one directory for everything a single piece of work
// produces, across the phases it takes to produce it.
//
// Design: docs/DESIGN.md#efforts.
//
// Why this exists. A change moves through design, survey, probe and one or more runs, and each
// phase wrote its output somewhere different or nowhere at all. Run state went to
// `.claude/vfa/runs/`, the knowledge base to `.claude/vfa/kb/`, designs to the source tree —
// and a survey's findings and a probe's findings went NOWHERE. The only record of a probe was a
// harness temp file, session-scoped and swept. Since the design skill recommends that the
// design pass and the develop pass be separate sessions, everything the first one learned that
// did not reach the design document was gone before the second one opened.
//
// What this is NOT. It is durable scratch, not evidence. The knowledge base holds claims
// anchored to measured file digests, checked against the current tree on every read, and
// admitted to the survey-collapse arithmetic. Nothing here is anchored, nothing here is
// checked, and nothing here may ever collapse a phase:
//
//   AN EFFORT'S STORED SURVEY NEVER COLLAPSES A PHASE. It is prior context handed to the next
//   pass, and nothing more. It reduces how much the next pass has to search by telling it what
//   the last pass found. It never proves anything.
//
// That rule is not a preference. The null survey's gate reads exactly one field —
// `entries.filter((e) => e.state === 'fresh')` — and reads no kind and no provenance, so any
// evidence reaching it is admitted on freshness alone with no grading whatsoever. A store whose
// contents could reach that gate would launder an unverified note into a skipped phase, which
// is the one failure IRON LAW §4 exists against.
//
// Nothing is minted here either. A phase's return is stored exactly as it was returned — there
// is no `about` to derive, no `observed_at` to anchor and no source to stamp — and the writer
// is the SESSION that ran the phase, using the shell it already has. No agent was added to the
// roster for this and no capability changed.
