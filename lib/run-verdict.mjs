// lib/run-verdict.mjs — what a run has already done, computed rather than reconstructed.
//
// Design: docs/DESIGN.md#resume-verdict.
//
// This is the deterministic half of a resume. Given a run directory and a repository it emits
// ONE small payload saying, per work order, which single action comes next — and nothing else
// about the run needs deciding by a model.
//
// What it replaces. A resume used to reconstruct that answer inside the workflow script from
// state lines, journal lines and a scavenge agent's report, all of which reached the script
// through a courier's structured output. Every field was at risk of a paraphrase, and the one
// field with no digest behind it — `partition_raw` — was mangled three times running on one
// repository in 2026-08. A partition that will not parse reads as "no waves", which degraded
// the whole run to "every order is coupled" and offered four already-merged orders back to the
// session to be reimplemented. Here it is `JSON.parse` over a file.
//
// The two regimes, and why they are asymmetric on purpose.
//
//   CLEAN — an empty ledger and no branches for this runstamp means there is nothing to
//   salvage BY DEFINITION, and the machinery must know that without dispatching anyone to look.
//   Order branches are named deterministically, so one `git branch --list` bounds everything a
//   dead invocation could possibly have left. Nothing there, nothing recorded: every order is
//   `code`, and no further git runs. This is what makes opening a parked plan as cheap as
//   planning it.
//
//   DIRTY — each order's lifecycle is a fixed sequence, the records say which steps closed, git
//   says whether the commits those steps closed over are still there, and the next undone
//   action is where that order resumes. Never earlier. A whole-order rebuild while committed
//   work sits on its branch is the failure this file exists to prevent, and it is at its most
//   expensive in exactly the situation where the budget already ran out once.
//
// Nothing here is stored. `plan.json` records what was decided and the two JSONL files are
// append-only records of what happened; a status computed over them cannot be stale, while a
// status written down outlives the thing it described. Same stance as lib/run-status.mjs, one
// question deeper: that file answers "where is this run", this one answers "what do I do next".
