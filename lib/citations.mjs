// lib/citations.mjs — the evidence a written artefact cites, resolved once for every reader.
//
// Contract: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-increment-25-contracts.md §2.

//
// Why this exists, measured rather than assumed. One probe of a 120-line document against this
// repository ran 17 agents and billed 36.5M tokens to return ~538k of evidence — 68×
// amplification. The cost is TURN COUNT, not payload: every turn re-sends the accumulated
// context, so an agent running 40 turns against a context growing toward 80k pays roughly 3.2M
// in cache reads, and sixteen of those is the whole bill. It is superlinear — the most
// expensive analyst ran 62 turns for 4.36M, the cheapest 34 for 1.30M. Nobody ingested a large
// file: `Read` returned about 26k tokens per agent across the entire run. Sixteen analysts each
// spent roughly 26 exploration calls independently LOCATING the same evidence.
//
// `vfa-survey` already solved this shape — its planner names shared ground once, it is searched
// once, and every analyst receives what it found. The probe never inherited the pattern. This
// script is that pattern for a document: an artefact cites its evidence by path and line, so
// one pass resolves that surface and every analyst receives the excerpts alongside its charge.
//
// Why a script and not a scout. Extracting `path:line` from text and reading those lines is
// deterministic, and standing requirement 6 says a deterministic thing is a script. A scout
// would buy a resume-to-exhaustion search to do it. The one thing a script cannot do is follow
// a citation that is WRONG — and that is not a loss, because an unresolvable citation in a
// document about to be built from is itself a finding, and it is reported as one rather than
// silently walked past.
//
// This resolves what the document POINTS AT. It is not the repository, and an analyst still
// reads whatever its axis needs — the excerpts are a starting point that removes the twenty-six
// calls everyone was paying to find the same lines.

 * A citation candidate: a path-shaped token, optionally with a line or a line range.
