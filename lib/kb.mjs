// lib/kb.mjs — the project knowledge base: anchored observations on disk, and every judgment
// about them computed on read.
//
// Contract: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-increment-13-contracts.md.
// Design: docs/2026-08-30-proposal-hierarchical-knowledge-base.md (increment 1 of three).
//
// Why this exists. Every run used to open blind on ground a previous run had already paid to
// see: the survey re-bought repo shape at 400–500k tokens a time, and the run's own `knowledge`
// set — the coders' discovered gotchas — died at the run boundary, so run N+1 started as
// ignorant as run 1. Two consecutive runs in the same subsystem shared 21 of 44 paths.
//
// Why it is not a cache of prose. This plugin's own objection to stored status applies with
// full force here: a status computed cannot be stale, while a status written down outlives the
// thing it described. So the file holds what was SEEN and where — never whether it is still
// true. Freshness is derived on every read, by this file, from git and from the bytes on disk.
//
// Three laws follow, and all three are arithmetic rather than policy:
//
//   Depth is derived.        An entry's place in the tree is LCA(about) — the narrowest
//                            directory containing everything it is about. Nobody files an entry
//                            "under" anything, and an entry whose subject moves is re-filed by
//                            arithmetic rather than by memory.
//   Freshness is derived.    Git first: no commit has touched the subject since the entry was
//                            observed, so nothing can have invalidated it. Otherwise the bytes:
//                            digest each anchored file now and compare.
//   Nothing is written back. The checker never stamps a state onto a line. Same stance as
//                            lib/run-verdict.mjs, for the same reason.
//
// The git-keyed freshness rule is the amendment the probe forced on the proposal. The principle
// is event-invalidated trust, and the tempting event log was this pipeline's own run ledger —
// but the KB outlives runs, and hand commits and triage-routed direct sessions never write a
// ledger line at all. Ledger arithmetic would therefore certify a stale entry fresh. Git is the
// event log every writer of this repository actually appends to, whoever they are.
//
// What the shortcut does NOT see is uncommitted work, so it is not trusted where the tree is
// dirty: one `git status` per invocation names the moved paths, and an entry whose subject sits
// among them goes to the digest check like any other. An unobserved change must never read as
// no change (IRON LAW §2).
//
// Increment 13 implements ONE anchor class: the file anchor. Guardians (a pinned test that fails
// when a broad claim dies) and surface globs (for absence entries) are increment 18's, and the
// schema is open to them — `anchors` is an array of objects and `kind` already names the four
// kinds. An anchor class this version cannot check never reads as fresh; it demotes the entry to
// a lead and says which class it could not check. That is forward compatibility that fails safe.

 * The deposit's own bytes, from a FILE or from an argv token.

 * base64 on one argv slot is this plugin's answer to free text crossing a shell, and it has one
 * ceiling nothing about the encoding can lift: a command line is finite. Windows caps a process's
 * at 8191 characters, and a run's deposit is as large as the run was interesting — ten entries in
 * 20260902-124933 came to an 8.1 KB command that the shell truncated mid-quote. The courier then
 * did what a good courier does and tried a heredoc, then a script file, each of which embedded
 * the same 8 KB in the same one command, so each failed identically.
 *
 * So the token may instead be written to a file and the PATH passed. A path is short whatever the
 * deposit weighs, and reading it is the safe direction — a file's bytes reach this process without
 * crossing a model at all. `--b64` stays for small deposits and for every caller already written
 * against it; when both are given the file wins, because it is the one that cannot have been
 * truncated on the way in.
