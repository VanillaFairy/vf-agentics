// lib/merge.mjs — the merge, as a script rather than as a model's discretion.
//
// Merging an approved branch into the run's integration worktree is entirely deterministic:
// run `git merge --no-ff`, and either it produced a commit or it produced conflicts. There is
// no judgement anywhere in it. It was nevertheless an instruction in a prompt — "run this,
// and NEVER resolve a conflict" — which is a rule enforced by the obedience of a model
// trained to be helpful, at the one point in the pipeline where being helpful is catastrophic.
//
// A silently resolved conflict does not look like a failure downstream. It produces a real
// sha, the wave verification runs against a tree that builds, and every later wave is built on
// a merge nobody reviewed and nobody knows happened. The loci in a wave were declared pairwise
// disjoint, so a conflict means the plan's independence declaration was wrong — a planner
// defect a human needs to see, not a merge for an agent to negotiate.
//
// So the abort is a `git merge --abort` in this file, and the agent's only job is to run the
// command and paste what it printed. Same shape as lib/run-verdict.mjs: a payload plus a
// digest the caller recomputes, because bytes never ride a model.
