// lib/commit-series.mjs — the commit series IS the review artifact.
//
// Pure core: `parseLog` reads the delimited `git log` text described in
// docs/.../shared/interfaces.md §3, as extended by increment 10's contracts; `analyzeSeries`
// runs the mechanical checks a verifier can decide without judging intent. Both are plain
// data-in/data-out functions —
// no fs, no child_process, no process — so they can be unit-tested directly.
//
// CLI wrapper (import.meta.main only): shells out to `git log`, prints the findings as
// JSON, and turns "any blocking finding" into a process exit code the workflow can check.
