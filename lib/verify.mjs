// lib/verify.mjs — the four mechanical checks of one work order, as one script.
//
// Contract: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-increment-11-contracts.md.
//
// The verifier is the most-dispatched role in the pipeline and its verify mode was ~90%
// command execution with verbatim transcription — on sonnet, once per order and once more per
// fix round. Running a command and copying its exit status is not judgment, and IRON LAW §8
// says cost comes out of method: a deterministic thing is a script. So the commit-series check,
// the build, the suite and the discriminator all happen here, in one process, and what the
// dispatch carries back is one digest-covered line of JSON.
//
// WHAT DID NOT MOVE. The verdict predicates stay caller-side, in
// workflows/vfa-develop.workflow.js and lib/run-verdict.mjs, untouched. This file decides
// nothing about whether an order passed; it observes, and the payload it prints has exactly the
// fields the caller's `verifyOk` already reads. That is the whole safety argument for letting a
// script do this work: nothing here can certify anything.
//
// ABSENT IS NOT FAILED, IN EITHER DIRECTION. `absent` means the repository defines no such
// command at this commit; `failed` means a command ran and exited non-zero. A shell cannot tell
// the two apart — a missing command and a broken build both come back non-zero — so this file
// NEVER infers `absent`. It is recorded only when the caller declares it (`--build-absent`),
// which is a fact somebody established. A command the caller did not name and did not declare
// absent is `command_unknown`: a typed error, escalated to a model, never quietly recorded as a
// repository with no build.
//
// THE ENVIRONMENT CHECK IS FIRST AND IT REFUSES. The discriminator stashes and moves HEAD. Doing
// that in the tree a human is working in destroys work, so this file establishes that it is
// standing in a LINKED worktree before it touches anything — the same refusal agents/verifier.md
// has always carried, moved from prose a model reads into a check a process makes.
