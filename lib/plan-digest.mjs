// lib/plan-digest.mjs — the content-bearing tripwire for a plan that travels through a model.
//
// Contract: docs/.../2026-08-16-increment-3-whole-change-and-design/shared/interfaces.md §1.
//
// A run's plan is written to disk by the planner and read back by a loader agent on resume.
// Between those two points it passes through a model, so every field in it is at risk of a
// paraphrase: a reworded `context`, a dropped `acceptance` entry, a rewritten `locus`. A
// count-and-ids manifest sees none of that, and a wrong locus does not surface as "the plan
// was corrupted" — it surfaces downstream as a blocking locus breach, blamed on an honest
// coder.
//
// So the manifest is per-order and digest-bearing. The planner runs this CLI when it writes
// the plan; `vfa-develop` recomputes the same digest in-script over whatever the loader
// returned and halts loudly on the first mismatch, naming the order.
//
// The digest must therefore be computable in TWO places: here, with a module loader, and
// inside a workflow script, which has neither imports nor `node:crypto`. That rules out any
// hash from the standard library and rules in FNV-1a, which is thirty characters of integer
// arithmetic and identical wherever it is written. It is not a cryptographic hash and is not
// used as one: the threat model is an honest model paraphrasing a field, not an adversary
// crafting a collision.
