// lib/programme.mjs — the layer above a run. Reads a programme's authored graph and its
// append-only event log, and derives where every slice stands. Nothing about progress is
// stored; everything is recomputed on every call.
//
// Contract: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-17-increment-5-contracts.md.
//
// Why this exists. `design` produces one document and hands `develop` one ratified change, so
// a system whose honest decomposition is several deliverable slices has no shape: it becomes
// one oversized run, or staging written in prose that nothing reads and nothing keeps true.
// In the field that prose was a hand-maintained table whose stage said `pending` while the
// stage was in flight — a stored claim outliving the thing it described, which is the exact
// failure `lib/run-status.mjs` opens by refusing, reproduced one level up.
//
// So the split here is the same one, at the higher grain:
//
//   programme.json   AUTHORED facts. Slices, containment, dependencies, contracts. Never
//                    progress. Written by a `plan` session with the user, and its existence
//                    IS that session's authorization — nothing stored claims an approval.
//   state.jsonl      EVENTS. Append-only, four types, each recording an act that happened.
//                    An event cannot go stale; a status can.
//
// The present is a function over those two plus what the filesystem says right now, and it is
// computed here. Everything in the pure core takes its filesystem facts as arguments — marker
// completeness, run rows, events — so the arithmetic is testable over hand-built fixtures
// without building a repository per case. The reader below is the only part that touches disk.
//
// Two `landed`s, and they are different scopes on purpose. A RUN lands when its integration
// head reaches its own `base_ref` branch — for a slice run, the programme branch. A SLICE
// lands when the programme branch reaches the user's branch, which happens once, for all of
// them, at the end. A run that landed is finished as a run and has reached the user not at all.

//
// Prefix-grained, and that is a stated limit rather than an oversight. `provides.paths` are
// directory prefixes, so this catches a contract's files moving, being deleted, or gaining
// neighbours; it cannot see a semantic change inside a file it never names. The user rules on
// every flag regardless, so the check errs toward showing rather than filtering.

 * @param {string[]} moved  repo-relative paths, raw from git

 * `unexamined` is the half that makes this honest. An undesigned slice declares nothing to
