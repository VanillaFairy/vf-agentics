// lib/run-status.mjs — derives the state of every vf-agentics run in a repository from the
// artifacts those runs already wrote. Nothing here is stored; everything is recomputed.
//
// Pure core: `partitionOf`, `deriveRun`, `statusOf`. Contract is
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-increment-4-contracts.md §3.
//
// Why derive rather than store. A status field is a claim, and a claim outlives the thing it
// described: a run interrupted between merging its last order and appending its state line
// would carry `integrated` forever while its own state.jsonl said otherwise, and the file
// that was wrong would be the one a human read. plan.json and state.jsonl cannot be wrong
// about themselves — one records what was decided, the other is append-only and records what
// happened — so the status is a function over them, computed on every call.
//
// The one input that cannot come from those two files is whether the integration head has
// reached the user's branch. That is a fact about git, so it is *passed in* rather than read
// here: the pure core stays testable without a repository, and the CLI below is the only
// part that shells out.
//
// Four statuses and a fifth that is not a status. `planned`, `in-flight`, `integrated` and
// `landed` describe progress. `unreadable` describes this tool's inability to tell — a run
// whose plan will not parse has not failed, it has gone unmeasured, and IRON LAW §2 forbids
// writing one as the other. A caller that treats `unreadable` as `planned` re-plans work that
// may already have merged.
//
// `landed` here means one thing only: **this run's integration head reached its own
// `base_ref` branch.** A programme has a `landed` of its own — a slice whose work reached the
// user's branch — and the two are different scopes, deliberately. A run that landed on its
// programme branch is finished as a run and has not reached the user at all.
