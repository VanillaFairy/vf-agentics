// lib/gc.mjs — the tidy-up after a run is accepted, as a script rather than as an afterthought.
//
// The develop skill has always said what happens once the human accepts the merged result:
// remove each implemented worktree, then delete the order branches. Nothing ever did it. In the
// field it was done by hand — 10 worktrees and 23 branches swept in one afternoon on 2026-08-27,
// 11 stale branches on 2026-08-20 — and one of those sweeps found a test stranded on a branch
// tip whose feature had already shipped without it.
//
// The gate does not move: this runs behind the human's acceptance, exactly where the skill
// already put it. What moves is who performs it.
//
// THE REFERENCE POINT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY. `git branch -d` refuses a branch that is not merged
// into HEAD, which is precisely the property worth having — but only when HEAD is the checkout
// that contains the integration merge. Run from anywhere else it either refuses everything (a
// checkout behind the merge) or, worse, answers a question about a tree nobody meant to ask
// about. So this file establishes the reference point first and refuses to do anything at all
// until it holds.
//
// Everything after that is keyed on ONE property: is this branch in HEAD? A merged branch's
// worktree is pruned and the branch is deleted; an unmerged one keeps both. That single test is
// why nothing here needs to read the run's ledger. An escalated order never merged, so its
// branch and worktree survive without gc being told which orders escalated; a held red whose
// green never landed survives for the same reason. The safety and the salvage are the same
// question asked once.
//
// Scope, deliberately narrow: refs matching `vfa/<runstamp>-*` and the worktrees checked out on
// them. Not the harness's own `wf_*` worktrees, which are shared territory across plugins, and
// not tags — a tag pointing into a deleted branch keeps its commits reachable, which is exactly
// what a salvage marker is for.
