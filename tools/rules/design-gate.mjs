// tools/rules/design-gate.mjs — pins the clauses that make a gated skill a gate.
//
// Two skills in this plugin end by moving something the user owns, and each carries a small
// number of sentences that are the whole of that contract. All of them are the kind of thing
// an edit softens without meaning to, and none of them fails loudly when it goes: the skill
// still reads well, still runs, and has quietly stopped doing the one thing it existed for.
//
// A MAP rather than one list, keyed by file. When this rule was written it was scoped to
// `skills/design/SKILL.md` alone, and its own header said so: "widening this rule is a
// decision to make when a second gated skill exists, not before." The programme skill is that
// second skill, and it settles the question the same way — by widening the shape rather than
// by generalising the clauses. Most skills have no terminal handoff and no gate; asking every
// SKILL.md for one would be noise, and a rule that produces noise gets ignored wholesale.
//
// The clause sets are DIFFERENT on purpose, and the difference is the interesting part. The
// design skill has a HARD GATE because ratification is a human act at a moment where a wrong
// shape still costs one paragraph. The programme skill has none, because §3.4 of the
// programme design abolished per-leaf ratification outright: authorization there flows from
// the plan artifact existing at all, and that artifact can only come into being through a
// session with the user. Forcing design's clauses onto it would pin a ceremony the design
// deliberately removed — which is to say the rule would enforce a bug.
//
// DECIDABLE HALF ONLY, deliberately — the same split `tools/rules/task-tool-fallback.mjs`
// and `tools/rules/coverage-block.mjs` make. This rule checks that each clause is NAMED. It
// cannot check that the surrounding prose still means it; that is review's half, and a rule
// pretending otherwise would be the laundering the IRON LAW forbids.
//
// Known limit, accepted: each check is satisfied by the token appearing anywhere, including
// inside a sentence that rules it out ("this skill has no HARD GATE"). Naming the clause is
// the half a regex can decide; meaning it is review's.
//
// Turn caps are NOT checked here — `tools/rules/no-turn-caps.mjs` already covers every
// SKILL.md in the plugin, and a second rule saying the same thing would report every
// violation twice.
