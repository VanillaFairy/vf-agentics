// tools/rules/task-tool-fallback.mjs — IRON LAW §4 support rule, applied to skills.
//
// The Task tools (`TaskCreate` / `TaskList` / `TaskUpdate`) are host-provided and OPTIONAL.
// Some hosts do not expose them at all — the VS Code extension is the one you will actually
// hit — and a skill cannot detect that until the call is already failing.
//
// A skill that routes its result through them with no stated fallback degrades in the one way
// this plugin exists to prevent. The session improvises, most likely into `TodoWrite`, which
// has no dependency edges: `blocked_by` is silently dropped, and a task list that lost its
// ordering looks exactly like one that never had any. The user is handed a partial result
// wearing the shape of a whole one, with nothing saying so — IRON LAW §4.
//
// So: name the fallback in the skill, or do not depend on the tool. What the fallback must
// actually do is written where it belongs, in the skill itself — carry the graph in the list
// (emit in `blocked_by` order, open dependent descriptions with "After <subject>: …") and say
// out loud that you fell back.
//
// DECIDABLE HALF ONLY, deliberately, and the same split `tools/rules/coverage-block.mjs`
// makes: that rule checks for a coverage KEY and leaves the block's substance to the scenario
// harness. This one checks that a fallback is NAMED and leaves its adequacy to review. Whether
// the prose actually preserves the ordering, and actually announces the degradation, is not
// decidable by regex — and a rule that pretended otherwise would be the laundering it exists
// to catch.
//
// Known limits, both accepted:
//   - False positive: a skill naming a Task tool only to rule it out ("this is not a
//     TaskCreate job") is still asked for the fallback token. Cheap to satisfy, and the
//     alternative is parsing intent.
//   - Vacuous pass: the word `TodoWrite` anywhere in the file satisfies the check, including
//     inside an unrelated sentence. Same trade as above — naming the fallback is the half a
//     regex can decide; meaning it is review's half.
