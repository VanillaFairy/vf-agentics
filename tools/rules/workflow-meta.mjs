// tools/rules/workflow-meta.mjs — pins a workflow's meta literal against three silent failures.
//
// 1. An unprefixed name. The workflow namespace is flat and global across every installed
//    plugin, so `survey` collides with anyone else's `survey`. The `reasonable` plugin already
//    had to rename its audit workflow after exactly that. Every workflow here is `vfa-*`.
// 2. A `phase('X')` call with no matching `meta.phases` entry. `meta.phases` drives the progress
//    display; an unmatched call silently gets its own ungrouped box. Nothing throws — the
//    display is just quietly wrong, and no test run will ever show it.
// 3. A meta literal that is not literal. The runtime reads this block STATICALLY and never
//    evaluates it, so `description: 'a' + 'b'` is valid JavaScript that the runtime refuses —
//    and a refused workflow does not register at all. Nothing anywhere says so; the workflow is
//    simply absent when something tries to invoke it. That is not hypothetical: `vfa-probe`'s
//    description was a two-line concatenation, it passed every check in this file, and the
//    installed plugin never had the workflow.
//
// Deliberately NOT flagged: the reverse check, a declared phase with no `phase()` call. That is
// a normal intermediate state while a workflow is being written, and flagging it would fight the
// author instead of helping them.
//
// The declared set is read from the `phases:` array span only, not the whole meta literal, so a
// stray `meta.title` sitting next to `name` declares no phase.
//
// No parser: strings and comments are blanked (below) and the rest is regex plus brace counting.
// V4 is the one check that needs the ORIGINAL text as well — an interpolation lives inside a
// template literal, which is exactly what blanking erases — so the scanner reports the string
// spans alongside the blanked copy.
