// tools/rules/coverage-block.mjs — enforces IRON LAW §4.
//
// "A partial result must never be indistinguishable from a whole one." The coverage block
// (interfaces.md §5) is the only thing that tells them apart, so a workflow that returns
// nothing, or returns a result without one, hands its caller an answer that looks complete
// no matter how much evidence was dropped on the way.
//
// Most of a workflow script is prompt text, and prompt text is full of braces, the word
// return, and ${} interpolations — all of which read as code to a naive scan. So strings and
// comments are blanked out first, and everything below runs on what is left. Everything:
// blanking the source and then reading any part of the ORIGINAL back out un-hides exactly
// what the blanking was for, and inside a returned object that turns a sentence of prose
// into a coverage block.
//
// Three findings:
//   V1 (line 0)     nothing is returned at all — undefined reaches the caller
//   V2 (line 0)     something is returned, but no returned object carries a coverage key
//   V3 (that line)  a bare `return` — an early exit with no result and no coverage
//
// The block's field list is { complete, dropped, incomplete, failed_channels, unreached,
// resumable }, plus `from_kb` since increment 14 — the provenance of anything a result recalled
// from the project knowledge base rather than searched for today. It is deliberately NOT demanded
// here, and this rule's behaviour is unchanged by it: absence must read as "nothing came from
// cache", so a workflow that never touches the base is correct to omit it, and a rule insisting on
// an empty array would turn the safe default into a lint failure. What a change to that field list
// must cite is docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-increment-14-contracts.md §3, and the question it
// must answer is the one that section was written against: does this field let a reader tell a
// partial result from a whole one? A field that does not is decoration on the one structure
// IRON LAW §4 rests on.
//
// Both spellings of the key count: `coverage:` and ES shorthand `coverage`, the latter in
// every position it can occupy — first key, last key, somewhere in the middle, with or
// without a trailing comma, on one line or written out one key per line (D10/D11). The first
// real workflow written against this rule had to rename a parameter to work around the
// shorthand form being rejected, which is the linter being wrong rather than the workflow.
//
// Deliberately NOT flagged, because catching them needs a real parser and this repo has no
// dependencies. All four are covered by human review at T18:
//   - `return { ...base }`            -> a coverage key that arrives only through a spread
//                                        lives in another object the rule cannot follow
//   - `if (!x) return`                -> an inline bare return shares its line with code
//   - `const r = {...}; return r`     -> no object literal at the return, so V1 fires
//   - a helper's `return {...}`       -> telling script scope from function scope needs a
//                                        parser, so the rule asks that AT LEAST ONE returned
//                                        object carries coverage, not that every one does
//
// One known false positive, same root cause: the blanker has no notion of a regex literal,
// so an unpaired quote inside one (`/can't/`) opens a string that swallows the rest of the
// file and the real return with it. Telling a regex literal from division is exactly the job
// of the parser we do not have. No workflow in this plugin uses one today; if that changes,
// hoist the pattern into `new RegExp('...')`.

 *
 * Allowing whitespace to span newlines is what makes the multi-line shorthand work; matching
