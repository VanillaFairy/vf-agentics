// tools/rules/no-self-verdict.mjs — IRON LAW §2 support rule, extended from coverage to review.
//
// A workflow schema that offers a verdict-named boolean (`approved: { type: 'boolean' }`)
// invites a prompt to ask a model to set it — and the moment that happens, the review loop's
// exit condition has quietly migrated from computed JS into a model's self-assessment. This
// rule bans the verdict names outright, everywhere in a workflow file, regardless of which
// schema or which agent it feeds: `tools/lint.mjs` never knows which agent a schema is for,
// and neither does this rule.
//
// The line is verdict names vs. fact names. `build_ok` / `suite_pass` describe an observed
// command exit status — a fact. `approved` / `passed` / `ok` / ... describe a judgment about
// acceptability — a verdict. The ban is by exact key name, which is crude and exactly as
// decidable as this rule needs to be.
//
// Known limits, both from the same root cause: the match is a regex over raw text, not a
// parser, and a parser is deliberately out of scope for a ban this crude.
//   - False positive: a schema-shaped fragment inside a comment or string still matches,
//     because nothing here distinguishes code from prose — e.g.
//     `// Example of what NOT to write: approved: { type: 'boolean' }` gets flagged even
//     though it declares nothing. Telling "real schema" from "text that looks like one"
//     needs a parser.
//   - False negative: a nested object sitting between the banned key and its `type` escapes,
//     because `[^}]*` cannot cross the inner object's closing `}` — e.g.
//     `accepted: { description: { note: 'nested' }, type: 'boolean' }` is not flagged. Brace
//     depth tracking (as `tools/rules/coverage-block.mjs` does for its own object spans)
//     would close this, at the cost of the parser this rule is choosing not to grow.
// Both are accepted: the spec calls this ban "crude and exactly as decidable as we need",
// and every schema in this plugin is hand-written by an agent working from the shared
// interfaces doc, not adversarially obfuscated — the failure mode this rule exists to catch
// is an honest `approved: { type: 'boolean' }`, which it catches every time.
