// No minItems / maxItems / minLength / maxLength anywhere: structured outputs do not support

// dropped one. Every bound lives in the prompt as behaviour and is enforced in JS.
//
// No verdict booleans either. `build` and `suite` name an observed command exit status, or
// the observed absence of any such command — facts either way. `approved` / `passed` would
// name a judgment, and the moment a schema offers one, the loop's exit condition migrates
// out of JS and into a model's self-assessment. Every verdict in this file is computed below.

// One work order, as a shape of its own. WORK_ORDERS carries a plan of them; ORDER_SLICE
// carries exactly one back from disk on a resume. Two hand-copied transcriptions of the
// same schema drift, and this one has to match exactly or a resumed order implements

//
// A byte-for-byte behavioural copy of the same pair in lib/plan-digest.mjs, which a workflow
// script cannot import — it has no imports and no node:crypto. FNV-1a over a key-sorted
// canonical serialization is thirty characters of integer arithmetic and is identical wherever
// it is written. Key sorting is what lets an object re-emitted with its keys in another order
// digest the same: that difference changes nothing about the record and must not read as damage.
//
// Two things are digested here, both about TRANSPORT rather than about the plan:
//
//   the resume verdict — computed by lib/run-verdict.mjs, which prints the number beside the
//     payload. This script recomputes it over what the courier actually handed back, which is
//     what makes every field of that payload — the wave layout above all — impossible to
//     corrupt undetected.
//   each state line — minted here, handed to the recorder with its digest, and refused by
//     lib/ledger.mjs if what arrives does not match.
//
// The per-ORDER digest is no longer computed in this script. It used to be, because the plan
// came back through a courier and had to be checked on arrival; orders no longer travel at all,
// so the number is computed by the CLI off the same disk the plan sits on and confirmed by the
// agent that fetches the order. If these two functions ever diverge from lib/plan-digest.mjs,
// every resume halts on a false digest mismatch — test/run-verdict.test.mjs and
// test/ledger.test.mjs pin them together.

//
// A state line is minted HERE, whole, and has to reach lib/ledger.mjs through an agent typing a
// shell command. The digest already makes corruption detectable; this makes it unlikely, which
// is a different and better property — a detected corruption still costs the run a retry, and
// the retry is typed by the same agent against the same shell.
//
// The heredoc it replaces is shell syntax, and everything that broke it was shell syntax too:
// a Windows path's backslashes, an apostrophe in a test name, a closing delimiter that arrived
// indented. Base64 has no metacharacters. One opaque token on one argv slot, nothing in it for
// a shell to interpret, and the digest still checked on the far side.
//
// The field case: run 20260829-140744 lost its wave-1 line and every order-escalated line to a
// mismatch that survived three attempts by the recorder — while every journal line, written by
// the working agents themselves, landed. Journal lines still go by heredoc and must: they carry
// values only the observing agent knows, so there is nothing to encode ahead of time.
//
// Written out by hand for the same reason canonical/fnv1a are: a workflow script has no imports
// and no Buffer, and both of these are small enough to be identical wherever they are written.

    `file you forget becomes a blocking breach for an honest coder. Acceptance criteria are ` +
    `independently checkable and each names how it will be verified. ${acceptanceNote}\n\n` +
    `Separately, every order declares its READS: the files it builds against and never ` +
    `modifies — the types it calls, the module its context describes, the interface it ` +
    `implements. You already know these; they are the survey evidence you wrote the context ` +
    `from. Write them down. This is NOT a write permission and never widens the locus.\n\n` +
    `They matter because a plan can be parked and resumed days later, and it goes stale in ` +
    `two ways. An order whose own files moved is one; an order whose DEPENDENCY moved is the ` +
    `other, and without reads it is invisible — the resumed run sees an empty intersection ` +
    `and dispatches a coder against a description of a world that no longer exists. Only you ` +
    `can record this, because only you are looking at the evidence right now. An order that ` +
    `genuinely builds against nothing gets an empty list, and that is a real answer.\n\n` +
    `Declare deps honestly: when an order's context names types, files, commands, or ` +
    `modules that another order creates, that order's id goes in deps. File-disjoint loci ` +
    `are NOT build-independence — an order supplying the build manifest, lockfile, compiler ` +
    `config, or shared constants is a provider: every consumer names it in deps, and it ` +
    `must never touch a designated shared file, because the partition refuses a plan whose ` +
    `provider is coupled rather than schedule work against a toolchain that never lands. ` +
    `An integration order that wires other orders together depends on every order it ` +
    `wires. deps is [] only when an order truly builds on nothing here.\n\n` +
    `Your deps are load-bearing twice over now: ALL waves run in this one invocation, and ` +
    `after each wave the approved orders are merged into an integration branch that the ` +
    `next wave builds on. An order whose provider escalated is not dispatched at all — it ` +
    `is reported as blocked, naming the provider. A dep you omitted therefore does not ` +
    `merely mis-schedule work; it sends a coder to build against something that never ` +
    `landed.\n\n` +
    `Set role on every order — 'none' is the default and the common case. For behaviour ` +
    `worth an independent examiner, split it into the red-green-refactor cycle instead:\n\n` +
    `   role 'red'      — locus is TEST FILES ONLY. Lands tests that fail for want of an ` +
    `implementation.\n` +
    `   role 'green'    — locus is IMPLEMENTATION FILES ONLY, deps names the red order. ` +
    `Makes them pass.\n` +
    `   role 'refactor' — optional third step, deps names the green order. Restructures with ` +
    `the tests green.\n\n` +
    `The separation is enforced by the loci you declare, so declare them disjointly: the ` +
    `commit-series check blocks any commit reaching outside a locus, which is what stops the ` +
    `green order editing the tests it is being measured against. That is the entire point — ` +
    `one agent that writes both the test and the code certifies its own reading of your ` +
    `criteria, and an exam written by the examinee passes by construction.\n\n` +
    `Split where a criterion pins BEHAVIOUR worth pinning independently. Do not split ` +
    `scaffolding, wiring, config, or docs: a red order for something with no behaviour to ` +
    `assert produces a test that cannot fail, which fails verification and wastes two orders ` +
    `to say so. When in doubt leave role 'none' — the ordinary path already runs the ` +
    `discriminator, which catches a test that pins nothing.\n\n` +
    `Set contract true on an order whose output other orders build against — a vocabulary ` +
    `note, shared type definitions, an interface. An ambiguity in a contract propagates ` +
    `into every consumer, so majors block a contract order downstream the way criticals ` +
    `block any other.\n\n` +
    `Set weight on every order. It says how much READING the order takes — how much of the ` +
    `codebase somebody has to hold in their head to get it right — and it buys the model ` +
    `tier that implements and reviews it:\n\n` +
    `   'light'    — mechanical and local. A rename, a config value, a delegation to something ` +
    `that already exists, a doc line. Someone who has seen only this order's locus can do it ` +
    `and can check it.\n` +
    `   'standard' — the default. Ordinary work inside a described context.\n` +
    `   'heavy'    — the reading is the work: subtle invariants, concurrency, a migration whose ` +
    `failure mode is silent, anything where the obvious implementation is the wrong one.\n\n` +
    `Judge the order, not its importance. Every order in the plan matters or it would not be ` +
    `in the plan; weight asks something narrower — whether getting this one right needs a ` +
    `strong reader. Marking everything heavy spends the user's budget on orders that did not ` +
    `need it and is the same as marking nothing. Marking a subtle order light is the more ` +
    `expensive mistake: it buys a cheap implementation and a cheap review of it, and the two ` +
    `agree.\n\n` +
    `A plan where nearly every order carries the same non-standard weight has not actually ` +
    `judged them — it has picked one label and stamped it across the board, which reads no ` +
    `differently from never having weighed anything at all. The run logs the distribution once ` +
    `dispatch starts, so a plan that skipped this step is visible to the user reading the log.\n\n` +
    `Compare the survey's coverage gaps against what the change itself names or leans on. ` +
    `A gap the change explicitly depends on goes in blocking_gaps — one entry per gap: the ` +

// ------------------------------------------------------- the red/green/refactor cycle
//
// A cycle is a red order and the orders that implement and restructure what it pinned. Its
// members are linked by `deps`, which the planner already declares, so nothing here asks
// anything new of a plan — the shape is READ, never decided.
//
// Why the cycle needs to exist as a unit at all: a red order's whole product is a failing test.
// Merged on its own it makes the integration head red, and every order in every later wave is
// then coded, verified and reviewed against a tree that fails for a reason none of them own. In
// the field (run 20260829-140744, 2026-08-29) that cost five escalations on finished, correct
// work and blocked thirteen more orders behind them: each green implemented its own red, was
// measured on a suite still failing a SIBLING pair's tests, and drew a fix round its coder
// could only answer with "these are not my tests". A no-commit answer escalates, so every green
// in the run was unpassable by construction.
//
// The fix is to keep the failing half and the implementing half together. A cycle member does
// not merge when it is approved; it is HELD, and the members that depend on it are anchored on
// its branch rather than on the integration head. When the last member is approved the branch
// tips are merged, carrying the whole stack with them. Two properties follow, and they are the
// point:
//
//   the integration head is never red — so no order is ever measured against another's
//     unimplemented tests, and a run that stops between waves leaves a usable branch
//   a green is measured on its own red's tests and nothing else — the strict verdict
//     `plainVerifyOk` already applies is the RIGHT verdict for it, so nothing is loosened
//
// The alternative was to teach each role's verdict to excuse the pending reds. That keeps the
// red head and makes three separate judgments laxer to tolerate it; this removes the state
// instead. `excusedRedFiles` below survives for the one case that still produces a red head —
// a run resumed from a ledger written before this change, whose reds are already merged alone.

    // untouched since it was observed. A stale entry is a lead, and a phase skipped on the
    // strength of leads is the laundering this whole plugin exists to prevent, so a chain with
    // any uncovered path refuses the collapse and says which path and why.

    // What collapses is the evidence PHASE, never a verdict: everything downstream — planning,
