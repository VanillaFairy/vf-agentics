//
// No minItems / maxItems / minLength / maxLength anywhere. Structured outputs do not
// support those constraints: they are stripped before the request or validated
// client-side, so a violation becomes a retry or a dropped result rather than a cap.
// Every bound below lives in the prompt as behaviour and is enforced in JS after the call.
//
// Field semantics go in `description`, never in a comment like this one. Comments are
// stripped before the schema reaches the model, so a contract written only in a comment
// binds nobody — and the coverage fields are load-bearing.

// The coverage contract every evidence-gathering agent answers to: the scouts, the historian
// and the doc-researcher alike. Completeness is DERIVED in JS from stop_reason, and a resume
// is driven by not_reached, so both have to arrive filled in.
//
// no_match and not_reached stay separate on purpose. "I looked and it is not there" is a
// FINDING — often the one that decides the question. "I never looked" is a HOLE. Merging them
// is exactly how a truncated search gets read as a clean result, and it also poisons the
// resume loop: the next round is handed things already established as absent and pays to
// re-search them.
// Every coverage field is ALWAYS present — an empty string is the correct value for "nothing
// to carry", and each description says so outright. The earlier wording ("must be non-empty
// whenever stop_reason is not exhausted") read to an exhausted agent as "must be non-empty",
// so it omitted the field it had nothing for, tripped required-field validation, re-submitted
// the same shape until the platform killed it, and a finished search was dropped whole.

// ---------------------------------------------------------- 5b. what this survey can deposit
//
// One kind, and it is the only one a survey can honestly mint: `absence`. A search that was
// EXHAUSTED and came back with nothing is the one thing a scout establishes that no later run can
// cheaply re-establish — it costs a full search to learn that a full search finds nothing.
//
// Two rules make it safe, and both were forced rather than chosen.
//
// ONLY FROM AN EXHAUSTED SEARCH. An absence from a scout that stopped early is a false negative
// written into the base as evidence, and the collapse arithmetic would then skip a survey on the
// strength of a search that never finished. `complete` here is `stop_reason === 'exhausted'`,
// derived by the resume engine and never claimed by an agent.
//
// THE ID IS MINTED FROM STABLE INPUTS. Shadowing works because re-observing a fact mints the same
// id from the same bytes, which is what makes newest-id-wins do any work at all. So the id hashes
// the topic's SUBTREE and its KEY — a path and a kebab slug, short and stable across passes that
// search the same ground — and never the claim's prose. The prose then carries what the scout
// looked for and did not find, and a later pass that phrases it differently SHADOWS its
// predecessor with better wording instead of appending a near-duplicate beside it. That is
// precisely the failure that keeps `structural` unwritten: a model-authored sentence rehashes
// every time, so the base grows without ever consolidating.
//
// This is an addition, not the relocation an earlier draft proposed: `vfa-develop`'s run-end
// deposit is untouched, and its two producers — `gotcha` from an approved order's discovered set,
// `command` from a verification — keep working exactly as they do, because both are built from
// run-time material that does not exist when a survey runs.
