// ---------------------------------------------------------------- why this exists
//
// This repository had the adversarial-probe pattern twice and could reach it from neither:
// welded into `skills/design/SKILL.md` step 3, where it only runs inside a design interview,
// and in `agents/reviewer.md`, which is adversarial but speaks entirely in acceptance
// criteria, commit series and declared loci — none of which a written proposal has. Probing
// anything else meant improvising a probe, and an improvised probe is run by the document's
// own author, which is the one reviewer guaranteed to share its blind spots.
//
// Two properties are the whole point, and both are structural rather than asked-for:
//
//   1. ARTEFACT-ONLY HANDOFF. A prober receives the document and the repository. It never
//      receives the author's reasoning, summary, or "what I was going for". A prober given
//      the intent probes the intent; a prober given the document probes the thing that will
//      actually be implemented, which is the only thing anyone will read later.
//   2. THE GATE IS COMPUTED. Probers return findings on a fixed ladder and have no way to
//      say a design is sound. Whether ratification is blocked is a count of open ambiguities,
//      computed here — the same discipline every other verdict in this plugin follows, for
//      the same reason: the moment a schema offers a verdict, the exit condition migrates
//      out of JS and into a model's self-assessment.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------- what a probe costs
//
// Measured on one probe of a 120-line document against this repository (`wf_bbd2fa8e-ae9`,
// 17 agents, 8m24s), from the seventeen agent transcripts rather than from this workflow's own
// report: 33.1M cache reads, 3.3M cache writes, 16k output — 36.5M billed to return ~538k of
// evidence. 68× amplification.
//
// The cost is TURN COUNT, not payload. Every turn re-sends the accumulated context, so an
// analyst running 40 turns against a context growing toward 80k pays roughly 3.2M in cache
// reads, and sixteen of those is the whole bill. It is superlinear: the most expensive axis ran
// 62 turns for 4.36M, the cheapest 34 for 1.30M — 1.8× the turns for 3.4× the cost. Nobody
// ingested a large file; `Read` returned about 26k tokens per agent across the entire run. What
// the turns bought was LOCATING: 248 Reads, 148 Greps and 16 Globs, sixteen analysts
// independently finding the same lines.
//
// Two levers follow, and they are of different sizes. The Ground phase below removes the
// duplicated locating and is the one worth having. The derived-axis cap is a dial: 110 findings
// landed on 21 sections of a four-claim document, fourteen axes independently attacked the same
// finding, and yield per axis is flat (3–10, mean 6.9) — so cutting axes buys less coverage
// rather than less waste, and it says so in the result instead of in a log line.
//
// Trimming what analysts READ is worth almost nothing, and an earlier reading of this cost
// that blamed large-file ingestion pointed straight at that lever. The transcripts refuted it.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- schemas
//
// No minItems / maxItems / minLength / maxLength anywhere — structured outputs do not
// support them, so a bound written here would silently do nothing or turn a good result into
// a dropped one. Bounds live in the prompt as behaviour and are enforced in JS.
