// ---------------------------------------------------------------- what this is for
//
// `vfa-survey` answers "how does the code we have work". This workflow answers a question
// nothing else in the plugin asks: **should we write this at all?** By the time `develop`
// runs, the change is ratified and the planner decomposes what to build; build-or-adopt is
// already settled. Design is the only stage where the question is still cheap, and it needs
// evidence rather than an opinion.
//
// The failure mode it exists to prevent is specific and quiet: a shallow look that finds
// nothing, followed by three weeks of writing something that was on a registry all along.
// That is why an empty candidate list is NOT a green light on its own — an empty list from a
// sweep that never reached crates.io is a different answer from an empty list after an
// exhausted one, and only the coverage block tells them apart (IRON LAW §2, §4).
//
// It recommends nothing. Licence tolerance, dependency appetite and "we want to own this"
// are the caller's to weigh; this returns the facts they weigh.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- schemas
//
// No minItems / maxItems / minLength / maxLength anywhere: structured outputs do not support
// them, so a bound written here would silently do nothing or turn a good result into a
// dropped one. Every bound lives in the prompt as behaviour and is enforced in JS.
//
// No verdict booleans. Whether a candidate is viable is COMPUTED below from the
// disqualifiers it was measured against — the moment a schema offers `suitable: boolean`,
// the decision migrates out of JS and into a model's taste.
//
// Field semantics go in `description`, never in a comment: comments are stripped before a
// schema reaches the model, so a contract written only in a comment binds nobody.

// The coverage contract every search channel answers to, identical in spirit to vfa-survey's.
// `no_match` and `not_reached` stay apart on purpose, and here the distinction is the whole
// point of the workflow: "I searched npm and nothing there does this" is a FINDING that
// supports building. "I never searched npm" is a HOLE that supports nothing at all.
// Every coverage field is ALWAYS present — an empty string is the correct value for "nothing
// to carry", and each description says so outright. Conditional-sounding wording ("must be
// non-empty whenever...") read to an exhausted agent as "must be non-empty", so it omitted
// the field it had nothing for, tripped required-field validation, re-submitted the same
// shape until the platform killed it, and a finished search was dropped whole.
