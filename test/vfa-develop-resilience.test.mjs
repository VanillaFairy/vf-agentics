// test/vfa-develop-resilience.test.mjs — the interruption story (proposal §5.4, §5.1, §9).
//
// The field incident this file exists for, 2026-08-17: a complex develop run died on a session
// limit. Its retry started from scratch. So did the next one. The plan sat resumable on disk
// throughout, worktrees held finished commits, and no entry point was ever required to look.
//
// Three mechanisms answer it, and all three are arithmetic rather than prose, which means only
// running them proves anything:
//
//   base_ref    — where the integration worktree branches from, A NAMED REF and nothing else,
//                 so that a later run can re-resolve the anchor instead of comparing it to
//                 itself and reporting a moved world as still.
//   the tags    — programme and slice on the plan envelope, so a run can be attributed to the
//                 slice it implements instead of being one more timestamped directory.
//   salvage     — deterministic order-branch names, so an interrupted run's work can be FOUND,
//                 adopted rather than rebuilt, and still put through everything.
//
// Since 0.17.0 the finding half of that last mechanism happens on disk, in lib/run-verdict.mjs,
// and reaches this script as one digested payload rather than as a scavenge agent's report.
// So the fixtures here say what GIT HOLDS — `gitFacts([...])` — and the verdict every scenario
// runs against is computed by the real lib from that, which is what makes these tests pin what
// the ladder decides rather than what their author believed it decides.
