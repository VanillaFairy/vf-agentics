// test/coverage-block-gaps.test.mjs — the two defects an adversarial audit found in
// the `coverage-block` rule, pinned. These are gaps, not a rewrite: the main suite in
// test/coverage-block.test.mjs stays exactly as its author left it, and this file sits
// alongside it so the audit trail is readable later.
//
// DEFECT 1 (high) — a `coverage:` sitting inside a string or a comment WITHIN the returned
// object satisfies the rule. The object's span is brace-matched over source that has had its
// strings and comments blanked out, but the span is then read back out of the ORIGINAL text,
// so everything the blanking was supposed to hide is visible again the moment it falls inside
// a returned object. The main suite already covers strings and comments, but its fixtures put
// them OUTSIDE the returned object, where nothing ever reads them — which is why they passed.
// Every fixture below puts them INSIDE. That one word is the whole bug.
//
// The consequence is the worst kind: a workflow with no coverage block at all lints clean.
// The rule that exists to stop a partial result from passing as a whole one (IRON LAW §4)
// quietly hands out a pass.
//
// DEFECT 2 (medium) — ES shorthand `coverage` is not recognized. This was written down as an
// accepted limitation, then hit by the very first real workflow written against the rule
// (vfa-survey, which had to rename a parameter to `coverageBlock` to get around it).
// Shorthand counts.
//
// Written by an agent who had seen neither the fix nor the original author's reasoning, on
// purpose.
