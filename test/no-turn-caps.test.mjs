// test/no-turn-caps.test.mjs — pins IRON LAW §1: completion is defined by the goal,
// never by a counter.
//
// The hard part is not detecting `maxTurns`. It is NOT detecting the three legitimate
// numeric patterns that ship in this very plugin: MAX_ROUNDS (the §3 resume threshold),
// the "around N tool calls, check for convergence" self-check in every search agent, and
// content bounds like "at most 12 tasks". A rule that flags those is worse than no rule,
// because it will be switched off and take §1 with it.
