// test/vfa-develop-typecheck.test.mjs — the third mechanical answer, and the note that reached
// nobody.
//
// A passing suite is not evidence that the tree compiles. Vitest and Jest transform TypeScript
// with esbuild, which strips types without checking them, so a missing key in a typed record is
// invisible to the suite and fatal to the build. In the field an order's branch tip carried 826
// passing tests over a tree `tsc --noEmit` rejected, and the suite result was the only thing
// anybody had to go on — the branch was left at a literal `Revert` commit with a broken build.
//
// `typecheck` is therefore its own field beside `build` and `suite`, never derived from either.
// Two properties are what make it safe to add rather than merely strict:
//
//   `absent` is the ordinary answer. Most repositories define no separate typecheck, and one
//   whose test command runs the compiler first is covered by `suite`. Nothing here manufactures
//   a gate out of that — an absent typecheck is a fact about the repository, exactly as an
//   absent build is, and it keeps `measured` honest rather than padding it.
//
//   A line written before the field existed reads back as `absent`, so a run planned under the
//   old verdict resumes under the old verdict. That half is pinned in test/run-verdict.test.mjs.
//
// The second subject here is F40's: a coder wrote a stage-blocking defect into `discovered`,
// which had one consumer — the knowledge-base deposit — and no reader before review. The defect
// cleared three green gates and surfaced at integration. Both of the coder's prose channels now
// reach the reviewer, so a misfiling costs a paragraph rather than a run.
