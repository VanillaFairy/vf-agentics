// test/commit-series.test.mjs — pins contract §3: `parseLog` (the delimited `git log`
// reader) and `analyzeSeries` (the mechanical checks a verifier runs before any expensive
// reviewer round). The commit series is the review artifact, so these two functions decide
// what the reviewer is even asked to look at. A false negative here buys an Opus round on
// work that should have been bounced; a false positive bounces work that was fine.
//
// The fixture shape is not invented. It was read off the real command with `od -c`:
//
//   \x01<40-hex sha>\x02<subject>\n
//   \n                                <- git's blank line before the name-only list
//   <path>\n
//   <path>\n
//   \x01<sha>\x02<subject>\n          <- next record starts immediately
//
// and a commit with no name-only output (a merge) emits ONLY the header line and its
// newline — no blank line, no paths — with the next \x01 following directly.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT PIN. These are the places contract §3 really does
// leave more than one honest reading open, so nothing below asserts a choice:
//
//   * Finding ORDER — neither within a commit nor across commits is specified, and
//     SPEC-DECISIONS ruling 2 confirms that consumers must not depend on it. Every
//     whole-result assertion below goes through `idsOf()`, which sorts. Nothing here
//     requires findings in the order the contract happens to list the checks.
//   * Message WORDING. The tests ask that a message exists, is not blank, and — where a
//     human reading the verifier's report needs it — that it names the file it is about.
//     Never the sentence itself.
//   * The CLI wrapper. §3 is explicit that only `parseLog` and `analyzeSeries` are
//     unit-tested; the CLI is exercised end-to-end at T11.
//
// HISTORY — this list used to be a great deal longer, and the reasoning behind it still
// holds: when the file was first written those questions genuinely were open, and guessing
// at them would have turned a guess into the specification. What changed is that the
// supervisor has since ratified every one of them in SPEC-DECISIONS.md. They are now
// pinned here, each in a test that names its ruling:
//
//   * A commit breaching on several files emits ONE FINDING PER OFFENDING FILE, each
//     naming its own file (ruling 3, case 8).
//   * `squash!` IS a wip subject. §3's regex was defective and has been corrected to
//     /^(wip\b|fixup!|squash!|temp\b|tmp\b)/i — see the note above case 10 (ruling 1).
//   * An empty locus `[]` permits NOTHING: every file touched is a breach (ruling 6).
//   * Locus comparison is case-SENSITIVE, and a locus entry never stands for a directory
//     prefix (rulings 7 and 8).
//   * `empty-commit` does NOT suppress the subject checks on the same commit (ruling 9,
//     case 14).
//   * `parseLog` returns paths and subjects VERBATIM. Separator normalisation belongs to
//     `analyzeSeries` at comparison time, so a parseLog fixture may now contain a
//     backslash and is expected to keep it (ruling 10).
//   * A file-path line is any line that is not exactly `''`, with NO trimming — a
//     whitespace-only line is a path (ruling 11).
//   * `and-subject` matching is case-SENSITIVE (ruling 5).
//   * `subject-length` counts UTF-16 code units, i.e. plain JS `String.length`
//     (ruling 12). This one was flagged inline at case 12 rather than in the list above.
//
// One of those pins behaviour the spec owner accepted with its eyes open rather than
// behaviour anyone would call obviously right: case-sensitive locus comparison is a known
// hazard on Windows and macOS, recorded as exactly that in SPEC-DECISIONS.md. It is pinned
// so that changing it means reopening the decision, not quietly "fixing" a test.
//
// CURRENTLY RED, ON PURPOSE. The last section of this file — CRLF line endings, ruling 13 —
// describes behaviour §3 now requires and the parser does not yet have. Those two tests are
// expected to fail until the parser is changed. Everything before them passes.

// =========================================================================================

//
// These two tests FAIL against the implementation as it stands, and are committed that way
// on purpose. They describe behaviour §3 now requires and the parser does not yet have; a
// separate change makes them pass. Everything above this line is green.
//
// §3: a single trailing \r is stripped from each line before the line is interpreted, so
// CRLF text parses identically to LF. Emptiness is judged AFTER that strip, which is what
// makes a line of "\r" empty rather than a file path.
//
// Ruling 13 spells out why this was fixed rather than filed alongside the case-sensitivity
// hazard, and the second test is the reason. On CRLF input a completely clean, fully
// in-locus series comes back with four blocking locus-breach findings: every path keeps its
// \r so none of them matches its locus entry, and git's blank separator line becomes a file
// literally named "\r". Correct work would be bounced at the verifier gate with evidence
// that reads exactly like a real breach. Case-sensitivity fails by MISSING a coupling,
// which is visible; this fails by INVENTING findings against work that was fine, which is
// not. Reachability is honestly defensive — git does not CRLF-translate log output through
// a pipe — but `parseLog` is exported and pure, and a parser that fabricates findings on a
// plausible input shape is worth the one line.
