// test/design-gate.test.mjs — the rule that keeps the design phase a phase.
//
// The rule is three substring checks, so the tests worth writing are the ones about SCOPE
// (it must not fire on other skills) and INDEPENDENCE (dropping one clause reports one
// violation, not three or zero), plus one that runs it against the real file — a rule whose
// own subject fails it is a rule nobody notices is wrong.
