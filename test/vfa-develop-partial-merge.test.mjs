// test/vfa-develop-partial-merge.test.mjs — an integration review over a tree that is not the
// whole change.
//
// The integration review exists to see what per-order review structurally cannot: two orders
// that each honoured their own contract and disagreed with each other. It reads the integration
// head, and when some orders escalated or were blocked, that head is only part of the change.
//
// A review of a partial merge can be entirely accurate about the state it saw and still point
// the wrong way. Run 20260902-124933 produced exactly that: an integration finding whose
// correct fix ran OPPOSITE to the one proposed, because two coupled orders were still missing.
// Nothing in the finding said the tree was incomplete, so nothing warned the person acting on
// it. That is the gap pinned here — in the reviewer's dispatch, and in every finding reported
// out of it.
