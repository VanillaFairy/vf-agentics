// test/vfa-develop-red-green.test.mjs — the RED/GREEN work-order split (increment 4, H2).
//
// A work order may declare `role: 'red' | 'green'`. A RED order lands tests that MUST fail —
// that is its entire purpose — so the ordinary verification verdict, which treats a failing
// suite as a defect, would spiral it through fix rounds forever. A GREEN order implements
// against those tests and cannot touch them, because they are outside its declared locus and
// lib/commit-series.mjs already blocks any commit that reaches outside one.
//
// The separation itself is free: `deps` waves GREEN after RED, and the locus fence is the
// same fence every order already stands behind. What is NOT free, and what this file pins, is
// that a red order's success condition is inverted in four specific ways — and that a wave
// whose merged head is knowingly red is distinguished from one that is merely broken.
//
// Written before the implementation. Every assertion here failed first.

// --- TWO pairs: the state that poisoned a field run ------------------------------------------
//
// Everything above this line uses ONE red/green pair, and with one pair the defect below is
// invisible: the only red test in the tree belongs to the only green order, which implements it,
// so the suite the green is measured against comes back clean.
//
// Add a second pair and the arithmetic changes completely. The partition packs file-disjoint
// reds into the same wave, so R1 and R2 both merge into the integration head; every wave-2 order
// then branches from a head carrying BOTH red test files. G1 implements R1 and is measured on a
// suite still failing R2's tests — which are not its own, not in its locus, and not its to fix.
// Its verification fails, a fix round opens, the coder correctly answers "these are not my
// tests, there is nothing here to change", and returning no commits escalates it.
//
// That is not a hypothetical. Run 20260829-140744 in the field (2026-08-29, 22 orders) escalated
// five orders this way and left thirteen more blocked behind them, having merged nothing but the
// test halves of pairs whose implementations were all correct: merged by hand afterwards, the
// same commits passed 1154/1154. The pipeline rejected finished work for a scheduling reason.
//
// The fixture below models the WORLD rather than the fix — `redTestsIn` answers "which red test
// files does the tree this order is being verified in actually contain", derived from what has
// been merged into the integration head at the moment of the dispatch. Any implementation that
// stops a lone red from reaching that head satisfies it; nothing here pins how.
