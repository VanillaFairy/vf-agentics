// Lint judges form and cannot reach any of this: whether a channel nobody ran is recorded,
// whether a verdict is matched to its topic by position or by a string the model retyped,
// whether a half-finished channel still reports complete. Each test below pins a way a
// PARTIAL result could come back wearing the shape of a WHOLE one (IRON LAW §4).
