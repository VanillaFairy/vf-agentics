// The property worth pinning is the reference point. `git branch -d` refuses an unmerged
// branch, and that refusal is the entire safety of this file — but "merged" is a question about
// HEAD, so it is only the right question when HEAD is the checkout that accepted the run. Asked
// from anywhere else it is answered confidently and about the wrong tree. So the first test
// below is the one that matters: from a checkout that does not carry the integration merge,
// nothing is swept at all.
//
// The second property is that unmerged work survives without gc being told which orders were
// escalated or held. A held red whose green never landed and an escalated order look identical
// to git — neither is in HEAD — and that one test covers both.
