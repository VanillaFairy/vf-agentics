// test/vfa-develop-fix-lane.test.mjs — the cheap lane, and what it refuses to make cheap.
//
// The triage section has been honest about its own numbers for a while: a ten-session field
// audit found SEVEN of ten better served by a direct session, and identified what the pipeline
// was actually buying in the other three — the adversarial review and the discriminator, not the
// survey and the decomposition. But triage ended by handing the work back to a plain session, so
// the two-thirds that pays got rebuilt by hand or skipped.
//
// This lane is that two-thirds, bought as a run. It is a lane INSIDE the develop workflow rather
// than a workflow of its own, which is the whole design: worktrees, the check runner, the review
// loop, the ledger, the resume verdict and the collector are inherited entire and unchanged, so
// the lane is resumable on the day it lands rather than after somebody remembers to make it so.
//
// What is pinned here is mostly what the lane does NOT skip. A cheap lane that quietly dropped
// the discriminator or the review would be cheap the way not doing the work is cheap.
