// test/run-verdict.test.mjs — the resume verdict: which single action each order resumes at.
//
// This is the arithmetic that used to live inside the workflow script, reconstructed there from
// state lines, journal lines and a scavenge agent's report — every one of which had crossed a
// model to arrive. It now runs on disk, over the real files, which is what makes it testable
// here at all: the whole salvage ladder can be exercised without a repository and without a
// single agent.
//
// The two regimes it must keep apart:
//   CLEAN — an empty ledger and no branches means nothing is salvageable BY DEFINITION, and the
//           machinery must know that without going to look.
//   DIRTY — a stage is adopted exactly as far as two independent sources agree: the run recorded
//           that it closed, and git still holds the head it closed over.
