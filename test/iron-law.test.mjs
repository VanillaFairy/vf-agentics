// softened, nothing else in the repo fails — the plugin just quietly stops being
// governed. This test is the only thing standing between the law and slow erosion.

  // reviewer says otherwise.") — this catches both.

  // A legitimate amendment to the law is expected to update this hash. That is the point:
  // it forces the change to appear in the diff as a deliberate act rather than a drive-by.

  // hashing the raw bytes would make the pin depend on which platform cloned the repo.
