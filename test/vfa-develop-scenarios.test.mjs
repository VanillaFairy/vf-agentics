// test/vfa-develop-scenarios.test.mjs — executes vfa-develop's orchestration arithmetic
// through the harness with scripted agents. Until the self-audit, no test ever RAN a
// workflow: coverage derivation, escalation routing, the checkpoint gate and the review
// loop's exit conditions were enforced by prose and regex alone. Each scenario here pins
// one of those mechanisms by observing the returned result, never the internals.
//
// The wave loop added a second family: the integration worktree, the merge run, the
// post-merge verification, the dependency gate that produces `blocked`, and resume by
// reference with its content digest. Those are the parts a reader cannot check by reading —
// they are arithmetic over what agents returned, and only running them proves anything.
