// test/commit-series-truncation.test.mjs — pins the self-audit fix to `parseLog`: a
// malformed record now throws instead of being silently skipped.
//
// The defect this pins away: `parseLog` used to `continue` past a record with no field
// separator, so a corrupt or truncated `git log` stream yielded a SHORT series that
// `analyzeSeries` then judged as if it were the whole one — a measurement failure wearing
// the shape of a clean answer, the exact laundering IRON LAW §2 forbids. The CLI's
// existing catch turns the throw into `{"error": ...}`, which the verifier maps to
// `stop_reason: 'environment_broken'` — unmeasurable, not failed.
//
// What is deliberately preserved: text BEFORE the first \x01 is not a record and is still
// dropped without complaint (real output starts with the delimiter, and the split used to
// produce a leading empty chunk). Only a separator-less chunk AFTER the first delimiter
// is impossible in healthy output.
