// The gate runs itself.
//
// Every other test in this directory checks a rule against fixture strings. None of them
// pointed the rule set at the real tree, and nothing else did either: no CI file, no git
// hook, no package script. `node tools/lint.mjs` was a convention living in CLAUDE.md, so a
// committer — human or coder agent — who ran only `node --test` shipped over a red gate and
// saw green. What a skipped run lets through is silent at runtime by construction: a
// workflow whose meta stopped being a literal is simply absent when something invokes it.
//
// So the gate is a test now. `node --test` alone carries it.
