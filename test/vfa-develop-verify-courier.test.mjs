// test/vfa-develop-verify-courier.test.mjs — the verify dispatch's transport ladder.
//
// Verification used to be a sonnet agent running four commands and typing what it saw into a
// schema, once per order and again per fix round. The commands are one program now
// (lib/verify.mjs), so the dispatch names it, a courier pastes its stdout, and this script
// recomputes the digest that stdout carries before believing a field of it.
//
// That leaves four things to pin here, and none of them is about whether an order passed —
// the predicates that decide THAT are untouched, and their tests needed no edits:
//
//   the happy path      — one courier, at courier grade, pointed at this order's own fence
//   damaged in transit  — one refetch, one tier up, and the run carries on as if nothing happened
//   carried by no tier  — an escalation that names the transport rather than the work
//   the runner refused  — a typed error is judgment, and buys an investigator instead
//
// The fourth is the one worth stating twice: `command_unknown` is what a repository whose
// verification commands nobody has established looks like, and what the investigator establishes
// then rides the rest of the run — which is what makes every later check a script.
