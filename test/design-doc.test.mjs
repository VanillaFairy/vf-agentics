// test/design-doc.test.mjs — pins that docs/DESIGN.md exists, keeps its shape, and that every
// pointer into it lands on a real heading.
//
// Lint family, same stance as test/no-turn-caps.test.mjs and test/iron-law.test.mjs: an
// invariant enforced against this plugin's own source, mechanically, forever. The invariant
// here is documentary, and it is the one that erodes without anything failing.
//
// DESIGN.md is the single description of the system as it is. Code, tests, skills and agents
// point into it as `docs/DESIGN.md#<anchor>`, and a renamed heading silently strands every one
// of those pointers. So the anchors are checked here rather than trusted: a pointer that no
// longer resolves fails the suite, and so does a link inside the document itself. This is a
// test rather than a lint rule for the reason test/verbatim-blocks.test.mjs gives — rule modules
// are pure per-file functions, and this comparison spans files.
