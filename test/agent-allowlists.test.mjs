// test/agent-allowlists.test.mjs — every agent's tool allowlist, pinned exactly.
//
// Lint family, same stance as test/self-lint.test.mjs and test/design-doc.test.mjs: an invariant
// enforced against this plugin's own source, mechanically, forever. Its sibling
// test/agent-frontmatter.test.mjs tests the RULE against fixtures — that a `tools:` key exists
// and is non-empty. This file tests the shipped tree, and asks the question the rule cannot:
// which tools, exactly.
//
// The frontmatter allowlist is the only capability mechanism this harness gives us. Hooks were
// ruled out on 2026-08-30 (docs/2026-08-30-reasonable-derivation-review.md, postscript), so there
// is no fence, no interceptor, and nothing that inspects a command — an agent can do precisely
// what its list grants and nothing else, and every other separation in the pipeline is prose
// backed by a post-hoc audit. The sibling plugin `../reasonable` carried the warning as a comment
// in its own charters: weakening one of these silently breaks an adversarial separation. A
// comment is not a mechanism. This file is.
//
// So the map below is the contract, and the friction is the feature. Widening an allowlist,
// narrowing one, or adding an agent with no entry here fails `node --test` rather than shipping
// quietly — and changing one means editing this file in the same commit, which puts the decision
// in a diff a reviewer reads instead of in a frontmatter line nobody diffs twice.
//
// Contract: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-increment-12-contracts.md §2.
