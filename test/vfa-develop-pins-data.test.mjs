// test/vfa-develop-pins-data.test.mjs — regression-net orders, and the round nobody can win.
//
// The discriminator asks one question of every test an order lands: did it fail before the
// change under it? That is the right question for a test written to pin a behaviour change,
// and it catches the real defect of a test written to be green.
//
// It is the wrong question for a test written to pin EXISTING CORRECT DATA. "The shipped
// bundle is still valid" was true at base too — that is the point of the assertion — and the
// only way to make it fail there would be to break the data first. Run 20260902-124933 held a
// correct test-only order for two fix rounds and needed a human to override the gate.
//
// Two mechanisms are pinned here, and they are deliberately independent. `pins: 'data'` lets
// the plan say what kind of test it commissioned, so the base question is not asked at all.
// `discriminator_undecidable` catches the order the plan FAILED to mark: a discriminator
// standing alone as the only failing fact cannot be moved by any commit inside the order's
// locus, so it goes to a person on round one instead of buying a round to learn that again.
//
// Both mechanisms were shown to bite the way this file's own subject demands: disabling
// `pinsData` fails the first and fifth tests here, disabling `discriminatorUndecidable` fails
// the sixth and seventh, and the rest are the negative controls that hold either way.
