// test/coverage-block-vacuous.test.mjs — pins the self-audit deepening of the
// `coverage-block` rule: a coverage KEY whose value is decidably empty no longer
// satisfies IRON LAW §4. The rule's message demands six named fields; before this,
// `coverage: {}` and `coverage: null` both linted clean — a partial result wearing the
// label of a whole one, waved through by the very rule built to stop that.
//
// The boundary is deliberate and narrow: only a literal `{}` and a literal `null` are
// decidable by regex. An identifier (`coverage: coverageBlock`) or ES shorthand may hold
// anything; judging THOSE belongs to the scenario harness, which executes the workflow
// and reads the real block. This file pins both sides of that line, so the rule can
// neither regress into keyword-matching nor creep into pretending it can read variables.
