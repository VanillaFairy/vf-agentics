// test/harness/workflow-host.mjs — executes a *.workflow.js the way the runtime does:
// strip the meta export, compile the body as an async function whose parameters are the
// runtime globals, and inject scripted fakes. This is what makes the orchestration
// arithmetic — coverage derivation, escalation routing, checkpoint gating — executable
// in a test, which no linter can do. Lint judges form; this harness judges behaviour.
//
// Fake semantics mirror the documented runtime:
//   pipeline(items, ...stages) — per item, stages run in order, each receiving
//     (prevResult, originalItem, index); a stage that throws drops the item to null and
//     skips its remaining stages. Items run sequentially here — the runtime's
//     no-barrier concurrency is a wall-clock property, not an observable result property.
//   parallel(thunks) — all thunks run; a rejection resolves that slot to null; the call
//     itself never rejects.
//   agent / workflow — delegate to the handlers the scenario supplies. A scenario that
//     supplies none fails loudly on first use rather than returning undefined.
//   budget — no target: remaining() is Infinity, matching a run with no token directive.
