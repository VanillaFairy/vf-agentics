// test/harness/verify-fixture.mjs — the repositories lib/verify.mjs is measured against.
//
// These fixtures are REAL: a real git repository, a real linked worktree, a real commit series,
// and a real test suite that really passes or really fails. None of that is negotiable — the
// whole value of test/verify.test.mjs is that the discriminator moves HEAD, restores files, runs
// a suite there and puts the tree back, and not one of those steps is observable against a mock.
//
// What IS negotiable is building the same starting repository from scratch once per test. That
// cost is not the thing under test, and on Windows it dominates everything that is: constructing
// the repo, its worktree and its series takes ~1690ms of git process spawns, against ~1500ms for
// the whole verify() call it exists to feed. Twenty-odd tests each paid it.
//
// So a template is built ONCE per distinct shape and copied per test. `git worktree repair` is
// what makes the copy legitimate rather than a trick: a copied worktree carries the template's
// absolute paths in `.git/worktrees/<name>/gitdir` and in `wt/.git`, and repair re-points both at
// wherever the copy actually landed. The result is an ordinary linked worktree — `rev-parse
// --git-dir` differs from `--git-common-dir`, `worktree list` sees it, and the discriminator's
// detached checkout and restore work exactly as they do on a freshly built one.
//
// The equivalence is not asserted here, it is TESTED: test/verify.test.mjs pins that a real
// verify() run over a clone produces a byte-identical payload to one over a freshly built
// fixture, for a green order and for a red one. That test is the licence for this file, and if
// a future change makes a clone diverge from real construction it fails rather than drifting.
//
// TWO WAYS TO BREAK THIS, both cheap to avoid and expensive to debug:
//
//   Template poisoning. A template is shared by every clone taken after it. Nothing may write
//   into one, so no caller is ever handed a template's path — `fromTemplate` copies out of it and
//   returns the copy, and the templates live under a root this module alone knows.
//
//   A worktree that was never repaired. Any fixture that registers more than one worktree must
//   repair each of them; a missed one does not fail loudly, it quietly resolves into whichever
//   directory the template happened to occupy.
