// test/run-verdict-git.test.mjs — the half of the verdict that shells out, against real repos.
//
// Everything else in this plugin's test suite hands `gitFacts`'s OUTPUT to the arithmetic as a
// hand-built object, which means the mapping from what git actually prints to that object was
// unverified — and a defect sat in exactly that gap and passed a green suite: when the
// integration branch did not resolve, every order branch came back `commits: []`, which reads
// as `code`, which re-anchors the branch and loses a reviewed series to the reflog. The develop
// skill tells the session to delete the integration branch after the human accepts, so that is
// the ordinary state of a run somebody comes back to.
//
// These tests build small real repositories. They are slower than the rest of the suite and
// they are the only thing that can fail on this.
