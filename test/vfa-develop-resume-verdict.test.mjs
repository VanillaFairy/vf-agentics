// test/vfa-develop-resume-verdict.test.mjs — the single-verdict transport ladder.
//
// This file used to be about a fan. Three designs stood here, and the first two failed the
// same way:
//
//   - 2026-08-19: ONE loader was asked to re-emit a 118KB plan byte-exact through a schema. It
//     copied 1 of 14 orders and paraphrased the rest — an output-length cliff, not a
//     comprehension failure — and the digest gate's halt cost a diagnosis and a relaunch.
//   - 2026-08: the fan that replaced it bounded every ORDER by its own size, but the index that
//     opened the fan still carried the envelope, the manifest, the state and `partition_raw`
//     through a model with nothing checking what came back. Three times running on one
//     repository the courier damaged the escaping in `partition_raw` — the one field with no
//     digest behind it — so it parsed as "no waves", and the run degraded to "every order is
//     coupled", handing four orders that were already built, reviewed and merged back to the
//     session to be reimplemented. One retry burned ~418k tokens and produced nothing.
//
// The lesson both times was structural: bytes must not ride a model. So the fan is gone and
// nothing is transcribed any more. `lib/run-verdict.mjs` computes the entire resume decision on
// disk and prints it with its own FNV-1a digest; ONE courier runs that command and pastes its
// stdout; the workflow recomputes the digest over what arrived. What is left to test here is
// therefore not comprehension but TRANSPORT — and the ladder around it:
//
//   damaged in transit  → one retry, one tier up, then the run carries on as if nothing happened
//   refused by the CLI  → carried through verbatim, NEVER retried
//   unreachable courier → a different answer again, and reported as itself
//   carried by no tier  → an honest halt that hands back NOTHING to reimplement
//
// The fixtures come from test/harness/resume-fixture.mjs, which builds each payload by calling
// the real `deriveVerdict`, so these tests pin what the ladder actually decides rather than what
// the author of the test believed it decides.
