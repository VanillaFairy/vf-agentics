description: Use when a change is worth designing before it is built — a new subsystem, a migration, an API, a reshaping of something that exists. Interviews the user against evidence the repository already holds, records their decisions, probes the design adversarially, and produces a ratified design document that vf-agentics:develop implements. Not for a change whose shape is already settled (use develop), and not for a question (use investigate).

# design

Produce a **ratified change**: the thing `develop` names as its input and that nothing in
this plugin previously produced.

The pipeline is **design → ratified change → develop.** Design work that does not happen here
happens in the implement phase instead, where a finding costs a fix round and a merge conflict
rather than one sentence in a document.

This skill is session-driven rather than a workflow, for one reason: interviewing is
interactive, and neither a workflow script nor an agent can talk to the user.

Invoking this skill **is** the user's opt-in for the `Workflow` tool. Do not ask again.

## When not to use it

- The change is already decided and the user wants it built. Go straight to `develop`.
- The user asked a question rather than for a design. Use `investigate`.
- The answer fits in a paragraph. Write the paragraph.

## Step 1 — Evidence before questions

Run the survey first, scoped to the idea:

```
Workflow({ name: 'vf-agentics:vfa-survey', args: { question, roots, notes, intelligence } })
```

`question` is what the design needs to know about the existing system — how the thing it
touches works today, what already exists that it should reuse, what constrains it. Not the
design question itself; the survey gathers evidence and never concludes.

`intelligence` is the tier every workflow this session launches runs at — this survey, and the
sweep in step 1b.

<!-- vfa:verbatim intelligence-tier -->
The dial follows the model this session is running, never how important the work feels:
**Fable → `max`; Opus → `normal`; Sonnet and everything below it → `low`.** When you cannot
tell what you are running, `normal`.

The judging agents belong at the tier of the session driving them. A session that dials itself
up because the change looked significant is charging the user for its own self-assessment; a
Fable session that leaves the dial at `normal` has its work judged by a weaker model than the
one the user is talking to, and a Sonnet session that claims `normal` bills the user for Opus
judgment nobody asked it for. Only the user moves it off that mapping — a bare leading `max`,
`normal` or `low` token, or `--intelligence=<tier>`.
<!-- /vfa:verbatim -->

**Every question the repository, its git history, or vendor documentation can answer is
answered here, not asked of the human.** The human is asked only what only the human knows:
intent, priorities, taste, real-world constraints, what they are actually trying to
accomplish. Asking a person where a function lives, when the survey could have found it,
spends the scarcest thing in the room to save the cheapest.

Keep `result.coverage`. It travels into the design document as it stands: an unreached
channel visible at design time is a decision the human can make now, and the same gap
discovered at the `develop` evidence checkpoint costs a whole survey and a whole planning
pass to discover again.

## Step 1b — Does this already exist?

`vfa-survey` searches the code you have. It cannot tell you that the thing you are about to
design is on a package registry, so run the outward sweep too:

```
Workflow({ name: 'vf-agentics:vfa-find-existing-solutions', args: { capability, roots, constraints, notes, intelligence } })
```

Run it whenever the design would **build a capability** — a parser, a scheduler, a cache, a
protocol client, a rate limiter, a diffing algorithm. Skip it when the design is about wiring
things this system already has, or reshaping code that exists: there is nothing off the shelf
for "how our checkout flow should be structured".

Read `already_present` first. A dependency this repository already carries beats every
external candidate and is the cheapest fact in the whole phase.

**Nothing here decides anything.** The sweep returns candidates, not a verdict, and adoption
turns on things it cannot see — licence policy, appetite for another dependency, whether the
team wants to own this code. Those are interview questions for step 2, and they are exactly
the kind only the human can answer.

Carry the result into the design document either way. A chosen candidate is a decision with
evidence behind it; the `no_match` lines that justify building are evidence too, and they are
what stops somebody asking in three weeks why this was not just a library. An **unfinished**
sweep is a `blocking` open question when the design leans on building from scratch — you
cannot ratify "we must write this" on a search that never reached the registry.

## Step 1c — Is this one change, or several?

A design whose honest decomposition is many deliverable slices has no shape in a pipeline that
hands `develop` exactly one ratified change. It gets built either as one oversized run — in the
field: thirteen orders, forty-two agents, 1.32M tokens, one order landed — or as staging in
prose that nothing reads and nothing keeps true.

So when the evidence supports it, **recommend staging and let the user rule.** The signals:

- an order-count estimate materially past one run's healthy size. The field number is **6–12
  orders in ≤3 waves**; it is folklore from one project, it feeds a recommendation, and it is
  never a computed gate;
- more than one deliverable the user could actually use;
- subsystems with narrow seams between them.

A design that stays a single change keeps today's shape exactly, and that is the common case.
A staged one becomes a **programme**: this skill writes the root design and the first slice's
leaf, `/vf-agentics:plan` turns it into a graph with the user, and `/vf-agentics:programme`
drives it. Read §4 of the layer's design before recommending it, so you can say what the user
is agreeing to.

**A slice is a deliverable, not a layer.** Each one ends with something a person can use. A
"data-model slice" nobody can experience is containment wearing a slice's name — it has all the
cost of a slice and delivers nothing, and the feedback that was supposed to shape the next
slice never arrives.

## Step 2 — The interview

**One question at a time**, walking the decision tree in dependency order — whatever
constrains other decisions is resolved first. A batch of six questions gets six shallow
answers and buries the one that mattered.

**Every question carries a recommended answer.** Ask through `AskUserQuestion`, put your
recommendation first, and mark it `(Recommended)`. A question with no recommendation is you
asking the user to do your thinking; a recommendation with no reasoning is you asking them to
trust you. Give the reason in the option's description, grounded in what the survey found.

**The user is the only author of decisions.** Never record a decision the user did not make.
A recommendation they did not answer is not adopted — silence is silence. Write each decision
in the user's own words, and keep the *why* whenever they gave one: a decision without its
reason cannot be revisited later, only re-argued.

**Grade every open question** as you go. The grades are interview discipline — they tell you
what to do next, and they are not pipeline fields:

- `blocking` — the design cannot be ratified without it.
- `parked: <what reopens it>` — set aside, with the trigger that brings it back written down.
- `lookup` — answerable from evidence. Go and look; do not ask.
- `compost` — interesting, not load-bearing. Recorded, not pursued.

One rule here is machine-consequential, and it is this: **a design with an open `blocking`
question does not hand off.** Not to `develop`, not to an implementation, not to "we can
settle that during the build". Everything else in this list is bookkeeping for you.

**Revisions rewrite in place.** When a decision changes, the document carries the ruling and
its reason — never the wobble history. A design that reads as a transcript of how the
designer's mind changed is a design nobody can implement from.

**Raise conflicts when they are load-bearing.** Do not sweep for contradictions. But when a
new answer contradicts a recorded decision that other decisions lean on, show both, say what
depends on which, and let the user rule.

## Step 3 — Approaches, then the adversarial probe

### The approach panel

Draft **two or three approaches in parallel**, one `vf-agentics:analyst` each, dispatched in
a single message. Every one gets the same survey verdicts and the decisions the interview has
recorded so far; each gets a different assigned stance:

- **minimal-change** — the smallest diff that satisfies the decisions recorded so far.
- **long-horizon** — optimise for the growth axes the interview actually named.
- **adopt-don't-build** — maximise use of what step 1b surfaced. Dispatch this one only when
  step 1b ran and found candidates; otherwise it argues from nothing.

Then synthesise: present them with trade-offs, recommendation first, each citing the survey
verdicts it leans on. An approach that cites nothing is an opinion.

Parallel authorship, not one author writing three times: independent drafts cannot anchor on
each other, so a menu written by one hand — where the second option is drafted in the shadow
of the first and the "alternatives" are one idea wearing three hats — stops being the default.

Two honest limits. **Selection is still one judgment**: the panel widens what reaches you, it
does not check your taste in choosing, and no scoring stage is proposed because the *user* is
the selector here and putting a model between the drafts and their choice would take a
decision this skill says is theirs. And **the stances are a fixed list**, so anchoring moved
up a level rather than away — `minimal-change` and `long-horizon` are close to two points on
one axis. When the interview names an axis these three miss, add a stance for it and say that
you did.

You may skip the panel when the decision space is genuinely pinned — the interview forced one
shape. Record the skip and the reason in the design document, so a skipped panel is visible
rather than silent.

### The probe

Before ratification, probe the design document with `vf-agentics:probe`:

```
Workflow({ name: 'vf-agentics:vfa-probe', args: { artifact, roots, context } })
```

Do not hand-roll a probe here. That skill owns the axes, the ladder, and the computed gate;
describing a second probe in this file is how the two drift until they rule differently on
the same document. It reads the target repository's own guidance for its axes — so a project
that mandates its own design review is satisfied by this probe rather than double-probed —
and always runs contract ambiguity, unnamed invariants, YAGNI, and **reinvention**.

Reinvention is a separate axis from YAGNI on purpose. YAGNI catches building what nobody
asked for; it will not catch building what everybody asked for and somebody already shipped.
Here it also has a specific target: is anything in this design rebuilding what step 1b found,
or what step 1b would have found had it been run?

`result.ratifiable` is the gate, and it is a count rather than an opinion — false while any
ambiguity is open, and false when any axis went unexamined. Read the probe's coverage block
before you act on a clean report.

The probe rules on the **design severity ladder** below — its own ladder, not the code one.
The code ladder speaks entirely in acceptance criteria, commit series and declared loci, and
a design document has none of those, so a probe holding it would have to invent a mapping
and would rule badly in both directions.

<!-- vfa:verbatim design-severity-ladder -->
- **ambiguity** — a term, contract, or interface the design leaves readable two ways. Blocks
  ratification. The archetype is one name with two incompatible definitions in the same
  document: every consumer implements one of them, the mismatch is invisible until
  integration, and it costs a rework round rather than a sentence.
- **gap** — a growth axis or requirement the design names but cannot absorb without rework.
  Resolved, or explicitly accepted by the user with the cost stated. Never silently carried.
- **note** — advisory. Recorded in the design document, never blocks, never loops.
<!-- /vfa:verbatim -->

Every `ambiguity` is resolved with the user before the design can be ratified. Every `gap` is
either designed away or accepted out loud, in the document, in the user's words. Notes are
written down and left alone.

## Step 4 — The artifact and the HARD GATE

Write the design in the target repository, and commit it. **You** write it — the agents in this
plugin are read-only by design, and artifact writing is the main session's job.

**Where it goes — a file for a single-change design, a directory for a programme.**

```
docs/vfa/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md          one change

docs/vfa/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/            a programme
  system.md            the root design — pure WHAT, and it carries NO graph
  slices/<slice>.md    leaf designs, written just in time (below)
  programme.json       written later, by /vf-agentics:plan
  plan.md              likewise
```

**The programme's identifier is the directory name, entire** — `2026-08-15-eva-plays-2`. There
is no `slug` field anywhere; a field restating the directory name can only ever disagree with
it.

Sections, in both shapes:

1. **Context** — the problem, and what the survey established about the system as it is.
2. **Decisions** — user-authored, each with its *why*. This is the section the design exists
   to produce.
3. **The design** — the approach, its shape, its contracts, its named invariants.
4. **Open questions** — graded, with `blocking` empty. If it is not empty, the design is not
   finished and step 5 does not happen.
5. **Settled evidence** — toolchain versions verified live, binding contracts, environmental
   facts ("rsync absent; transport is scp"), and the survey's coverage block as it stands.

That last block is not decoration: it is **the exact `notes` payload `develop` consumes**, and
it is what stops the evidence checkpoint re-litigating questions this session already settled.
Write it to be read by a planner, not by a person.

### Section markers — the machine-readable half

Three sections carry markers, in a root document and a leaf alike:

```
<!-- vfa:section change -->            one paragraph: the ratified change, verbatim
<!-- vfa:section decisions -->         the user-authored decisions
<!-- vfa:section settled-evidence -->  the payload a planner consumes
<!-- /vfa:section -->
```

They exist so everything downstream that consumes a design document does it **mechanically**.
`lib/programme.mjs --notes` concatenates marked sections byte for byte; the ratified change is
*extracted*, never composed; and a document missing a required marker fails loudly by name,
which is what keeps an empty payload from being indistinguishable from "no settled evidence".

They are also the **completeness signal**. A leaf whose required sections are absent is a
design that was never finished — whatever else is in the file — and the programme skill routes
it straight back to `awaiting-design`. That is the whole recovery mechanism for a session that
died mid-design: no ceremony, no re-asking, just a document that does not yet parse as done.

**Write them last**, as the final act of the pass. A marker present over a half-written section
is worse than no marker: it says finished.

### Leaf designs are written just in time

In a programme, **only the frontier slice's leaf is written at ratification.** Later slices
exist in the plan as positioned, contracted, undesigned nodes. Feedback beats prediction: a leaf
designed months early is designed at the moment of least knowledge, against a tree that will
not exist when it is implemented.

When an undesigned slice reaches the frontier, `/vf-agentics:programme` invokes **this skill**
with `programme` and `slice` arguments. In that scoped mode:

- the root document and delivered predecessors' leaves are **settled context** — read, not
  re-litigated;
- the survey and the interview are scoped to slice-local decisions;
- the leaf is written into the programme tree and committed on the programme branch;
- the probe runs on the leaf. The probers get the repository, and the root and predecessor
  documents are *in* the repository — so cross-slice contracts are probed as evidence the
  probers found themselves, never as author-supplied `context`;
- step 3's own gate applies unchanged: **the pass cannot end while a blocking probe ambiguity
  is open**;
- the markers above are emitted as the final act;
- **step 5 is skipped** — you return to the programme skill, which owns the dispatch, the
  envelope tags and the notes assembly.

If the leaf conversation reveals the graph itself is wrong — the slice wants splitting, a
dependency is missing — that is a plan revision. Say so and hand back; the user is by
construction present for the conversation.

**HARD GATE.** No implementation, and no `develop` invocation, until the user has read the
document and ratified it in as many words. Not "looks good so far", not silence, not your own
judgment that it is obviously right. This gate is the whole reason the phase exists: it is the
last point at which a wrong shape costs a paragraph.

In scoped mode there is no second ratification and no per-leaf "go". Authorization to build a
slice comes from `programme.json` existing at all — it can only have come into being through a
`plan` session with the user, so it *is* that conversation's work product. A leaf is
dispatchable when the plan exists and the leaf's markers are present. The gate above governs
the ratification of a design; it is not a second ceremony bolted onto every slice.

## Step 5 — Hand off

Once ratified — **a single-change design only; scoped mode returns instead** — read the change
out of the document rather than retyping it:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/programme.mjs" --section change --file <the design document>
```

`--section settled-evidence` prints the planner's payload the same way. Those two strings are
the whole handoff — `develop` surveys, plans, partitions and implements from them.

**Why the extra command instead of copying the paragraph.** The change string is a key, not a
description: `develop`'s existing-run guard and its resume guard both compare it exactly. A
rewrapped line or a normalized dash between one session and the next is a different change as
far as those guards can tell, so the duplicate they exist to catch goes through and the same
work is planned and implemented twice. Bytes never ride a model.

### Where the build runs — ask, do not assume

With both strings in hand, ask the user where `develop` should run. Use `AskUserQuestion`,
with these two options and no others; do not print them as prose and do not pick for them:

- **New session (Recommended)** — start `develop` in a fresh context, from the document.
- **This session** — chain straight into `develop` here.

**Why this is a question at all, and why the default leans away from the obvious.** Chaining
looks free — the design is right there, and one invocation carrying the whole change is what
this pipeline is for. It is not free. Everything this pass accumulated is still in the
context: the interview, the survey's returns, every probe round's findings. `develop` inherits
all of it and re-reads it on every turn of a run that can last hours, and none of it is load
bearing once the document exists. A measured run of this plugin started its build phase
carrying nearly 400k tokens of settled design conversation and paid for that inheritance on
every one of the build's turns; the same run's build driver, dispatching 185 agents over seven
hours, added only 70k of its own. The expensive context was inherited, not generated.

Nothing is lost by starting fresh, because nothing that matters lives in the conversation. The
document on disk is the entire product of this pass — that is what the section markers are for,
and what makes a session that died mid-design recoverable. A fresh session reads what a
continuing one would only be remembering.

**When continuing here is the better call — say so if it is.** The recommendation follows the
size of what this pass actually accumulated, not a rule. A short interview, a small survey and
a probe that cleared in one round leave little behind, and the handoff is then cheaper than the
re-entry. Long interviews, a wide survey, or a second and third probe round are the expensive
cases, and they are the common ones. Read the pass you just ran and recommend accordingly —
but let the user answer either way.

**If they choose this session:**

```
Skill({ skill: 'vf-agentics:develop', args: '<the change string, verbatim>' })
```

with the settled-evidence block as `notes`. `develop` is already aware it may be starting deep
— that is what its `--pause-between-waves` and `--plan-only` flags are for, and this is the
case they were written for. Say the plan size out loud when it prints.

**If they choose a new session:** give them one block to copy, carrying the extracted bytes
inline, and name the document so nothing has to be reconstructed:

```
/vf-agentics:develop <the change string, verbatim>
```

Copy-paste preserves the bytes; a retype does not, and the guards above cannot tell the
difference between a retyped change and a new one. Then stop. Do not invoke `develop` yourself
after handing over the block — starting the run here is precisely what the user declined, and
the design is already durable without it.

A **programme** hands off to the graph rather than to the build:

```
Skill({ skill: 'vf-agentics:plan', args: '<the design directory>' })
```

`plan` decides slices with the user; the planner agent inside a run decides work orders. Same
word, two grains, and they never meet.

Report the coverage honestly on the way out, the same as everywhere else in this plugin: if
the survey did not complete, say which channel did not, and say that the design rests on it.
A design built on two-thirds of the evidence reads exactly like one built on all of it.

## Deliberately not imported

The knowledge-graph interviewer's folder-tree machinery — parent nodes, node splitting, hub
shapes. A design document is one file with sections, and a storage model built for a graph
would be ceremony here. What is imported is the interviewing **discipline**: one question at a
time, in dependency order, with a recommendation attached and the user as the sole author of
what gets written down.
